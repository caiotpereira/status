## Git Server Migration

On Friday, 2024-08-16 at 18:00 UTC Foundries.io team will be migrating
source.foundries.io to a different data center. This will produce a few
minutes downtime while the changes propagate.

## Approximate timeline of events
* 18:00 UTC - prep work - do complete sync of data to new server
* **18:30 UTC** - current server will be changed to read-only mode (`git push` will be blocked)
* 18:31 UTC - delta-sync data from current server to new server again (will be much faster)
* **18:35 UTC** - new service will be marked active and will accept read-write traffic

There is no actual downtime planned. However, the service will run
in a read-only mode a few minutes.
